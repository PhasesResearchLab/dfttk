## üìù Overview

The **Density Functional Theory Toolkit (DFTTK)** is a Python package designed to automate VASP jobs and manage relevant results in MongoDB. VASP workflows leverage [Custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian), and data storage is handled via [PyMongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver).

## üîß What does DFTTK do?

### Enumeration of Configurations
- Enumerates **unique collinear magnetic configurations** for a given structure.

### VASP Workflows
- Performs **convergence tests** for:
  - Cutoff energy (`ENCUT`)
  - k-points grid density (`kppa`)
- Computes **free energy** using the **quasiharmonic approximation**.

### MongoDB Storage
- Stores and retrieves VASP **input data** and **post-processed results** in MongoDB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
It is recommended first to set up a virtual environment using Conda:

    conda create -n dfttk python=3.12      
    conda activate dfttk

Clone the main branch of the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/dfttk.git

Or clone a specific branch:
    
    git clone -b <branch_name> https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/dfttk.git

  Then move to `dfttk` directory and install in editable (`-e`) mode.

    cd dfttk
    pip install -e .

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note:** A PyPI release is currently under development.
