cstdn.py 

1. Change the name to something like workflows.py



Old functions:
# Function to extract the last occurrence of volume from OUTCAR files
def extract_volume(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        for line in reversed(lines):
            if 'volume' in line:
                volume = float(line.split()[-1])
                break  # Stop searching after finding the last occurrence
    return volume


# Function to extract the last occurrence of pressure from OUTCAR files
def extract_pressure(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        for line in reversed(lines):
            if 'pressure' in line:
                pressure = float(line.split()[3])
                break  # Stop searching after finding the last occurrence
    return pressure


# Function to extract energy from OSZICAR files
def extract_energy(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:

        for line in reversed(lines):

                energy = float(line.split()[4])
                break  # Stop searching after finding the last occurrence
    return energy
